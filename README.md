This script allows to rename a file or directory name. The general idea is that the filenames start with small letter, whereas the directory names start with capital letter.

Accordingly, if you have a plenty of files and directories on some directory and you want to put things in order on this directory with names, then you just run this script and it replaces small letter by capital letter in directory name and correspondigly it replaces capital letter by small letter in the filenames.
